 * Plugin URI:  https://github.com/andrewryantech/bitcoin-converter
 * Description: Convert any quantity of any currency to BitCoin in real-time.
 * Version:     1.0.0

 *
 * General Architecture:
 *
 * Code is divided into 2 sections, admin + public.
 *
 * When the system encounters a quantity to convert to or from Bitcoin, it performs a CURL call using the
 * WordPress standard HTTP API to get all latest bitcoin exchange rates. It then stores these values in
 * a singleton. Subsequent conversions then use these values in the singleton to avoid repeated CURL calls.
 *
 * Even though we may just need, eg USD -> BC rate, we get ALL rates as the cost of two calls, each for one currency, is far
 * more than the overhead of a single call for all currencies.
